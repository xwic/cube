Change Notes
============

	- FindUtil class for Cube browsing.
	- Added log() method to Cube class.
	- CubeFlexCalc support new autoCachePaths mode, using new class CachePath and CachePathDimensionDepth,
	  to pre-cache new Key paths usage. The trigger to calculate the cache (method buildCacheForPaths) is invoked
	  when total aggregation time of calcCellFromIndex and serialCalc calls exceeds last build cache time (1000 msec for first call).
	  Property buildCacheForPathsTimeout can be assigned instead of last build cache time.
	  Useful when cache statistics are not used or not applicable.

	- Added ICube.replace(ICube oldCube)
	- Added DataPool.replaceCube(ICube oldCube, ICube newCube)

2009-04-02	FLI
	- Added ICube.clear(Key);
	
2009 Jan till April
	- Added CubeFlexCalc implementation

2009-01-23	FLI
	- Implemented Externalizable interface for the cube's cell object, to speed up the serialization and
	  deserialization process and reduce the memory requirements during the load.

2009-01-21	FLI
	- Added possibility to reorder dimension elements
	- DifferenceFunction now can "negate" the result
	- PercentageValueFormat is creating the result with a NOBR tag to prevent line break
	- JDBCUtil stores the order_index of dimension elements to restore them in the same order. This requires a new database column!

2009-01-14	FLI
	- Added KValueFormatProvider
	
2009-01-13	FLI
	- The cube no longer creates the internal HashMap with the theoretical maximum capacity
	- DimensionElements with a '/' character in the key can no longer be created
	 
2008-12-30	FLI
	- Added IDataPoolManager.isDataPoolLoaded() method, to check if a DataPool is already loaded into memory.
	- Implemented JDBCSerializerUtil.restoreDimensions()
	
2008-12-29	FLI
	- Added listDataPoolKeys() to DataPoolManager.
	- Added JDBCSerializerUtil
	
2008-12-15	FLI
	- IDimension.getPath() now returns an empty string (as expected) and IDimensionElement.parsePath()
	  returns "this" if the argument is an empty string. 

2008-12-01	FLI
	- Added cube.clear(), cube.clear(IMeasure) and cube.clear(IMeasure, Key) to 
	  remove cells by measure/key.
	- Set cube.reset() to deprecated. Use .clear() instead. 
	- Fixed a StackOverflowException in the equals() method of the DimensionElement
	  that could happen when two elements are compared that are from different 
	  dimensions.
	  
2008-11-25	FLI
	- Optimized memory usage by refactoring the internal data model. This has
	  lead to a few API changes, but also improved performance. The memory
	  usage decreased by 24%, performance gain is at about 33%.
